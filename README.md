# NBA Playing Time

As our final project for Econometrics, we had the chance to apply many of the econometric principles we learned in our theory class using Python. We decided to investigate the partial effects of different variables on playing time in the NBA. I was in charge of writing all the code which ended up involved data manipulation, data visualization, and table creation. I was also in charge of the results and conclusion section.
